/*
 * Lodash and Underscore are great modern JavaScript utility libraries, and they
 * are widely used by Front-end developers. However, when you are targeting
 * modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are
 * already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and
 * ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies,
 * and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.
